I am learning data structures and algorithms from a book 'CS345-Algorithms-II-Algorithm-Design-by-Jon-Kleinberg-Eva-Tardos'
It's a great, detailed book but its exercises are bit complicated so i decided to train on my own
I don't care -in these files- about clean code and good architecture, and the reason why is that i amn't advanced in python and i only care about getting the algorithm succeeded 
HAPPY CODING!
